Shepherd Cape v2.3
==================

Changes Done for v2.4
---------------------

- Power Analog-Switch U30 from BB 3V3
- stabilize ADC with 22 pF at Input -> 60 kHz Fc
- stabilizing 1kOhm for VIOBuffer
- decide if rec & emu should be combined
    - more complex design
    - always complete package
    - reduced cost (~ 3*9 €)
    - emu gets voltage-measurement for free
    - -> no for now
- ADC seems to act up sometimes after sheph-EN -> test in PRU, reenable a couple of times -> seems to be fixed with EN
- Pwr-by-BB does not work with current cape-revision -> just add a switch?
    - switch for input power, 1 A, 5V Switch: https://www.mouser.de/ProductDetail/Dialog-Semiconductor/SLG5NT1594V?qs=sGAEpiMZZMtxrAS98ir%252BsxAQ5ATuKOGcAYPhn0zy8SaYiCqL8FxMXA%3D%3D
    - test shows that the unpowered watchdog is responsible -> add another diode to also power WD from BB 5V OR power diode directly from middle-pad of 2-WayJumper
    - tests still show unreliable starting-behaviour when BB-Pwrd (start on second try), hints at trouble with big coil & Cap -> also implement the switch
- remove overvoltage-protection, due to space constraints
- ditch LSF-LevelTranslator, use 74LVC2T45DC,125 with directed pairs
    - 74LVCH2T45GT, holds, 1.0 * 1.9 mm Package: https://www.mouser.de/ProductDetail/Nexperia/74LVCH2T45GT115?qs=jquClx72t9BCfx5QcUZHzg%3D%3D
    - 74LVC2T45GN, without hold, 1.2 x 1.0 Package
    - 74LVC2T45GS, without hold, 1.35 x 1.0 Package -> cheaper, more available
    - 4x100k-PU Array https://www.mouser.de/ProductDetail/YAGEO/YC124-JR-07100KL?qs=o9qB%2F%252BVTi4WdZhClKs2MsA%3D%3D
- programming biDir Pins
    - var1: skip leveltranslator and force 3v3 logiclevel, direct connection with analog Switch
    - *var2*: that one pin tdio must have a dir-pin -> hard if PRU-Pins needed
    - var3: still use slow LSF0104 for programming pins (try TI-Version for a change)
    - -> var2 is preferred if sys-gpio is working for programming, (YES, it is)
- GPIO to target, 7x GPIO, 2x UART (rx,tx), BAT_OK (tx)
    - how many gpio should be with variable direction? 2x2 rxtx, 5 static rx? ->
    - static-Dir TX: CLK1, TMS/CLK2, BATOK -> 2 x 2 CH Translator
    - static-Dir RX: UART-RX, 4x GPIO, -> 3 x 2CH-Translator
    - BiDir: TDIO1, TDIO2, UART-TX, 3x GPIO (4 Dir-Controlling Pins, 2 for programming, 2 for tx&GPIO and 2-4xGPIO)
        -> could be bundled in TDIO/GPIO-Pairs for a 2 x 2CH-Translators (NO)
        - if possible don't share Dir-Pins between programmer / gpio
- possible extension of target port
    - programming pins are exclusive and don't have to be recorded/monitored -> free pins should be used for additional gpio
    - a second target (with option of programming) would help for some usecases (MSP430 + nRF-Radio)
    - var1: analog switch on target-pcb for programming lines controlled by one of the gpio (exclusive or could still be used as gpio)
    - var2: analog switch on cape, 2x2 programming lines on target-port, also allows JTAG
    - var3: intermediate uC on target-pcb for programming targets talking with BBone over programming lines (very custom solution but cape is left untouched similar to var1)
    - -> Var2 preferred
- WD-Wake needs longer Pulse
    - currently 20ms High-Pulse gets inverted, but tests show that > 130 ms are needed
    - var1: diode + RC-Filter could widen the Pulse
        - wake-pin supplies 1mA max
        - SIM: 100 nF / 1 M -> 150 ms > 0.5V (On for MOSFET)
        - SIM: 1 uF / 1M ->  >>1s > 0.5V
    - var2: a single capacitor after the mosfet could suffice
        - BB-Schematic only shows a pull-down button
        - TPS65217C, PB_IN, Pin25, internal 100k PU
        - SIM: 1 uF from BB-START to GND shows 100ms delay for signal rise to 2.0V -> sums to 120 ms
            - ~ 64ms in real test
    - -> Var1 preferred, less dependant from BB-Design-Changes
- PUs on sys-side should also be powered by BB 3V3
- New Connector, 4x Pwr, 4x Prog, 10x GPIO -> 18 Pins -> 2x9 Connector
    - info1 -> BB outer width is 54 mm -> 27mm per module
    - info2 -> BB width between headers is 43.2 mm -> 21.7 mm per module
    - var1: remove mounting-holes and allow 2.54mm Connectors (2x 22.2 mm width)
    - var2: switch to smaller 2mm Connector, ~18mm width
    - -> var1 preferred
- GPIO-PUs increase to 100k
- combine shield-pads for EMU & REC
- change Analog switch to microbump-version 863-NLAS4684FCT1G
- change back vias from 550/200 to 600/250
- add more decaps for level-translators
- Remove dedicated harvest-led -> use pru0-LED for that

Changes still Open
------------------

- which rails would benefit from big Caps?
- emu-shunt should be stabilized with > 500 nF (and probably the others too)
- additional big Caps on Main-Rails
- Resistor Arrays?
    - 4x 100k https://www.mouser.de/ProductDetail/YAGEO/YC124-JR-07100KL?qs=o9qB%2F%252BVTi4WdZhClKs2MsA%3D%3D
    - others1 https://www.mouser.de/c/passive-components/resistors/resistor-networks-arrays/?resistor%20values=100%20kOhms&instock=y&sort=pricing
- Beta Tuning:
    - additional 1 nF Cap on Feedback LP, both paths
    - remove 100 nF parallel to shunt
    - give recorder equal layout
- optimize filters with noise-metrics
    - possible tradeoffs: speed of voltage-transitions, compensation of analog switch resistance
- finalize hardware (WD, filters, GPIO-Speed, current bugs)
- test harvesting-target
- get target naming A/B/1/2 straight. it is target 1/2 from now on!
- find reason for 2.3mA Offset
- diodes for coils if needed
- LED of PRU: dedicated pwr_good / harvesting on silkscreen

Trouble with v2.3c - manual P'n'P
---------------------------------

Fixed in v2.3d

- better comments for parts, U- , L-, R-.... T-
- SLG5... 4pin-mini-package, improve pin1-point and pad-layout should be hinted at ->
    - also longer pads,
- optimize NLAS-BGA, silk-lines, maybe extend corner-pads, peek over ic-edge or add right angles in copper
- 74LV LVLTrans - longer pads, at least the 4 corner ones -> maybe one package larger
- 0402 pads closer together
- u14 pads further apart
- the 3 new ICs -> maybe back to larger package?
    - 74LV as QFN, end-of-life: https://www.mouser.de/ProductDetail/Nexperia/74LVC2T45GM125?qs=sGAEpiMZZMtZ661ya8CuXWImkGMxfA6p9uS%252BIOJA%2FTA%3D

- 1 C tombstone (below emu, above u19)
- level-trans seem to be shorted (densest pad-layout)
- some ICs are shorted -> old paste
