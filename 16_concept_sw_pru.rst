Concept - Software - RT Units
=============================

- SPI to adc/dac -> use dedicated hardware and not bit-banging
    - bit-banging transfer takes 8 (DAC) - 12 (ADC) ticks per bit -> so 192 ticks for 24 bit at best (DAC) and 384 ticks for 32 bit (ADC)
    - no PRU-Peripheral is utilizable for it
    - Host-SPI is accessible by PRU (~40 ticks read delay for <= 32-bit writing should take 1 tick) -> Buffered, FIFO, allows 4-32 bit words, max 48 MHz
    - CS-Pins need precise timing, or at least repeatable (same delay, equidistant), so at beginning of IRQ-Loop
        - no IRQ to synchronize transaction!
        - start of transaction on host-spi can be half a SPI-Clock-Cycle accurate (Start Request -> CS Low)
        - CS Pin could be PRU-Controlled/Monitored-Pin
- GPIO to target
    - PRU-GPIO pin direction is controlled by host, in linux via device tree or alternatively via "cape-universal_"
    - PRU can't access host GPIO (i found no memory-mapping)
    - a trick would be to reduce PRU to an observer with his separate pins -> linux can then program, control and listen on it's own pins
    - one PRU could sample 16 bits with close to 100 MHz ...
    - there is no interrupt for PRU-pin-changes, but for transitions on host-gpio-modules
    - NOTE: some pins allow hardware-timestamping via int-routine, data-sheet even implies this is possible for all pins
- UART to target -> seems to be only host-controlled
    - could also be handled by PRU -> has dedicated UART (TL16C550) no autobaud, 192 Mbps, 16-bit FIFO
    - HOST-UART is accessible by PRU (~40 ticks read delay) -> (16C750), 300 bps to 3.7 Mbps, autobaud up to 115.2 Kbps
    - could just be monitored by PRU (GPIO)
- SPI to target
    - control by userspace seems to be the way to go, so user can decide whether to use SPI or just the GPIO
    - one additional SPI available
    - monitor and timestamp by PRU
- Programmer, currently for SWD, but also allow JTAG
    - should stay in user-space, SWD needs flexible pin-direction
- unify Pins to Target -> Programming, SPI, UART and GPIO
    - would be possible if Pins are controlled and used in Linux, PRU is just recording Pins
- I2C to dac (static voltage) handled by PRU, to minimize errors
    - PRU could access host-I2C
    - PRU can utilize MDIO-Interface for that
- vCap -> see sub-chapter below
- Scheduling
    - one PRU should do time critical things, i.e. sampling into ringbuffer in shared PRU-Memory → other PRU-Core should handle transfer to cpu-memory
    - work timer/interrupt-based with short transactions, could do pin-reading the rest of the time
- try to add unit tests for critical code sections (vCap) -> make it more modular
- benchmark the loop
    - timer, counter with min, max, mean with copy to host
    - or just use debug-pins to mark active parts and analyze like pwm
    - maybe more useful than disassembling via godbolt

vCap - Converter & Capacitor Emulation
--------------------------------------

- main future goals from the thesis regarding vCap
    - dynamic capacitance -> allow capacitor sweeps, find optimum cost by benchmarking the target firmware
    - energy aware debugging -> keep energy in capacitor constant during commands
    - support more targets, mainly msp430
- find a better name

PRU ICSS High-level-Overview_
    - 200 MHz cores
    - one 32bit-op per cycle
    - no division
    - 8 kB RAM per Core
    - 12 kB shared RAM
    - 3 banks of Scratch-Pad (=3x30x 32-bit registers) directly between the cores, 1Cycle Access
    - access to host memory, L3 interconnect (expensive wait, see benchmark below)
    - INTC, 64 events, 10 channels
    - access to host periphery (QSPI, GPIO, even USB), ~ 40 cycles read latency
    - CPU has mailbox system to send 4x 32-bit IRQ-messages to individual cores (also PRUs)

TI-Wiki_ contains datasheets for various sub-topics
    - PRU C/C++ optimization guide, presentations,
    - Subprocessor documentation
    - PRU-Projects_, notably
        - PyPRUSS (programming PRUs on beaglebone black),
        - libpruio (high speed data handling),
        - BeagleLogic (100 MHz, 14CH Logic Analyzer),
        - High Speed data aquisition

latency benchmarks (source: "sprace8a.pdf")
    - writes take normally 1 cycle, reads 2 to 14 (UART) cycles local, reads 30 - 40 cycles global (periphery)
    - transfer shared RAM to DDR 5 cycles / 4 byte, to 65 cycles / 128 byte
    - transfer DDR to shared RAM 47 cycles / 4 byte, 107 cycles / 128 byte -> prefer large chunks

PRUs (ICSS, ICSSG) Supported techniques (feature-comparison_)
    - mostly called (enhanced) EGPIO:
    - 16 bit parallel capture input for GPIO, r31[15:0] are DataIn, r31[16] is ClockIn
    - 28 bit shift input -> pru<n>_DATAIN, r31_status[27:0], with counter stats, internal clock source -> which pin?
        - WARNING: this seems to leave only ONE input
    - 3 Ch peripheral interface (on ICSS device dependent) - not found on BBB **??**
    - Shift output
    - **dedicated UART (with 16-bit FIFO, 192 Mbps) based on TL16C550**, no speedsense, but autoflow (cts, rts)
    - eCAP (enhanced Capture)
    - IEP (industrial Ethernet)
    - 2x MII_RT (media independent interface), MDIO (management Data IO)
        - each MII has 32 byte RX FIFO, 64 byte TX FIFO, even TX_EN (as Chip-select) but has clk input -> NO SPI

Beagle Black -> AM3358
    - 1 PRU = 2 Cores, 200 MHz, 8 KB IRAM (instructions) per Core, 8 KB DRAM per core, 12 KB shared DRAM, 17/17 GP-Inp, 16/16 GP-Out, 3 Banks Scratch Pad
    - eGPIO on register x30000 / pins pr1_pru0_pru_r31[16:0] (INP) and pr1_pru0_pru_r30[15:0] (OUT) for PRU0, same for PRU1 with changed register name
    - UART on register x28000 / pins pr1_uart0_rxd/txd/cts_n/rts_n
    - eCap on pr1_ecap0_ecap_capin_apwm_o -> capture input or aux PWM out
    - MDIO has an IO pin pr1_mdio_data

Beagle AI -> AM5729
    - 2 PRU, 200 MHz, 12 KB IRAM per Core, 8 KB DRAM per Core, 32 KB shared DRAM, 21/21 GP-Inp, 21 GP-Out, 3 Banks Scratch Pad
    - same peripherals as AM3358

Possible Compilers
    - ti c compiler, supports c99, asm and c++2003 (https://www.ti.com/tool/TI-CGT#PRU)
    - gcc pru port, in mainline now, (https://github.com/dinuxbg/gnupru/wiki)

Program - Optimizations
-----------------------

PRU Good Practice
    - passing of arguments: 16 registers to pass 32-bit each
    - auto-incrementing loops are without overhead [for (i = 0; i < X; ++i)]
    - O2 tries to rewrite div-const-int into reciprocal mult
    - mixing of asm, c, c++ can bring trouble when activating optimizations
    - a more efficient (single instruction) access to local memory in the lower 16-bits (__near), can be used
    - variables in shared memory always "volatile"
    - const helps, at least to save RAM (if defined at compile-time)

CCS Compiler Switches
    - opt_level=[1-4]
    - opt_for_speed=[0-5]
    - fp_mode=[strict] -> disable fp-usage
