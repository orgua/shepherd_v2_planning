## Implemented Changes v2.0r1

- Beaglebone
- Emulator
    - DAC
        - previous: **DAC8562SDGSR**, mouser 595-DAC8562SDGSR
            - 50 MHz SPI, 7-10 us Settling, 1-4 mV Zero-Scale-Error, 40 mA Short-Circuit-Current,
        - constraints: >= 16 bit, SMD, 2 CH, not maxim, v-range ~2.5...5.5 V, short settling time
            - this could also be low-res and slow for only bq-output-sim, but it would benefit to also tap in cap-voltage directly
            - https://www.mouser.de/Semiconductors/Data-Converter-ICs/Digital-to-Analog-Converters-DAC/_/N-4c44d?P=1z0w8k6Z1z0w2wwZ1z0w2wvZ1z0w2wtZ1z0z7ptZ1yz5pwlZ1yzmm10Z1yzml2aZ1yzmm18Z1yzmlprZ1yzmm0yZ1yzmm13Z1yzmlr9Z1yzmlh1Z1yzmlwtZ1yzmm16Z1yzmm0zZ1yyh4l4Z1z0zls6Z1yzxao2&Ns=Pricing%7c0
        - replacement: AD5663ARMZ-REEL7, mouser 584-AD5663ARMZ-R7
            - 50 MHz SPI, 4 us Settling, Zero-Scale-Error<1mV, 30mA Shor-Circuit-Current, needs voltage reference, WATCH OUT - there are versions with midpoint-start
        - replacement: DAC8830, 1-CH, 50 MHz, 16bit, 10nV/sqrtHz, 1us Settling,
        - replacement: AD5545B, 2-CH, 50

        - replacement: AD8606ARMZ-REEL, mouser 584-AD8606ARMZ-R
            - 2CH, 80 mA, 5 V/us, 8 nV/sqrtHz, 20 uV Input Offset,
    - shunt-Resistor
        - nRF52 takes 9 mA @ 4dBm, 16 mA @ 8 dBm for ~ 200 us, rest is below 2 mA,
        - previous: 2 Ohm 1% ⇾ 16 mA => 32 mV, would mean 1% Voltage drop at 3V3, less would be better
        - current sensors are no alternative, too expensive, not enough resolution
        - replacement: 1 Ohm 0.1% ⇾ 1:1 mA:mA, 0603 or 1206
            - **RT1206BRD071RL**, mouser 603-RT1206BRD071RL
    - OP-Amp for Shunt
        - previous: AD8422BRMZ in combination with LM27762DSSR

    - Target-Port-IO (GPIO, SPI, I2C, UART, SWD/JTAG, BAT_OK PRU) ⇾ Q: is HS-GPIO enough? rest is userspace-logged
- debug to target
    - voltage-level-translator,
        - previous1: TXB0304RUTR BiDir, autosense, min 3mA input drive current, 4 CH, >40 Mbps

- target-port ⇾ default pin-header, maybe smaller version of it
- suppply for second target ⇾ 2. CH of DAC + Buffer

    - sot-323-3: DMN2058UW-7, mouser 621-DMN2058UW-7
- i2c-storage, prev: CAT24C256WI-GT3
- Cage
- Part Properties:
    - price (for ten), manufacturer, manufacturer id, shop 1, shop 1 ID, ...
    - special properties: max voltage, power, current, size / package, color, forward Voltage
- extra information (i2c-adress, spi-speed, ) directly in schematic
- power-recording-stage
    - DAC DAC80501ZDGSR
    - OPAmp OPA388ID, pin-compatible with LTC2050HV
    - nMOS SI2374DS, test with BSH103
    - ShuntOPAmp Ina190A1IDCKR
- power in via vdd_5v (P5/6) ⇾ Test shows: BB does not power up via sys_5v
- reboot / boot via Pin-Toggle (Shutdown via command), we should trigger both (RESn⇾PD,PWR⇾PD), Test shows: Reset works while PWR is in PD
- add 256 GB USB-Stick
- switch to smaller IC-Packages and 0402
- order / add GPS
- is the gps capable of alarm (wake up sys)
- our 5V analog should be stabilized more! Add A5V with 2 Stage Bead, or real coil
- add footprint for layer-windows
- add footprint for shepherd-logo
- give INA190 a negative supply (>1mV would be enough) on GND-pin, ref stays on common gnd, extra decouple
- Debug-Pins with Ground
- extend harvest-Port, add option to measure VSense, and output VCap (V_A of Emulator)
- it would be wise to detach a5v even further from 5V, with a low-drop diode
- EMI-guard SPI, currentlimit at pinheader, terminate at ICs, 33 Ohms close to cpu recommended (avoid reflections)
- add alarm-feature, something SPI-programmable, that can act like a watchdog, with at least max 1-4h windows
- check against shepherd v1.5
- don't shut down individual Emu / Rec - Parts (delete or just disable all at once) ⇾ done by Pwr-control
- Harvester needs second channel ADC with very low input current, 1MOhm is too low
- manual button with LED ⇾ connector S4B-ZR-SM4A-TF, P1 3V3, P2 LED ODrain, P3 SenseButton with PU, P4-6 GND
- add ultra low noise LDO to A5V, and possibly a boost-converter upfront
- find better level translator, less current (best if near 0)
- reprocessed 11_concept.file
- switched Ina190 for AD8421
- added boost/Inverter for proper voltage rail
- add target port (comparator-include?) System will be a nRF52840 and most likely a MSP430
    - try to make it compatible with breadboard / dev-Kit
    - is spy-by-wire physically compatible with swd ⇾ it is, TClock is uni-dir, TDIO is bi-dir
- replace 100nF/16, 1uF/16, 10uF/16
- BOM, more precise alternative - BB uses 32.768 kHz osci MC-306 (20 ppm, 8x3.8mm) or similar, package says 327A5M
    - alternative: 5 ppm, 12.5pF, 50 kOhm, https://www.mouser.de/ProductDetail/Citizen-FineDevice/CM200C32768HZFT?qs=rkhjVJ6%2F3ELrGt3qchcVtQ%3D%3D
    - BB also uses 24.576 MHz
- check output limits of opax388 and DAC
- compare lowNoise LDO to LM27762
- 750 kOhm 1%,  667-ERJ-2RKF7503X, 5 + 32
- connect BB-Pins, 500 Ohm to input pins that could be driven from both sides
- complete ERC
- 1uF/16V is still 0603, change to 0402, there are 34x (incl. Recorder)
- redistribute capacitors
- replace coil with smaller one, check recommended direction
- add 1kR & 100R high precision for current measurement, EMU
- order digikey (extBut, samtec), mouser, csv
- add footprint for quality-control-panel
- BB Pinheader Cape-Design Stays ⇾ possible alternaltive Producer is Samtech, design is now divided
- add production-constraints
- update BOM
- v2r1 ordered

## Implemented Changes v2.0r2

- silkscreen - 10k array are 1k
- 3d-Step: shield transparent for better view below
- silk. "P3" designator is below component
- pads of 0402 bigger, 1.2x1.2 as min area for pads? paste 0.8x0.8? got some tombstones on current revision
   - half a pad distance to neighbour (keepout)
- improve connection betwenn pads (esp. 0402)
- feducial seems massive, shrink it?
- SPI-CS with at least 33R to lower chance of interference
- R for BatteryGood is wrong (handled by PRU), should it also be routed to userspace?
- TC7WH-Footprint is to large
- HC2G-comment (Name) is wrong / twisted
- DAC pads could be longer, reach more under the IC
- MP32 has no dot on package, just [ABC], lower left is pin1
- NSR (or all diodes) could get a line on the 3d-file (current dot is confusing, because the actual package has line and dot)
- the orange led is red! ... bad UI for general blinking
- describe gain of OP-Amp in schematic
- 100R, accuracy is missing in description / constraints
- Silk for L9/L10
- essential silk-numbers on headers can be bigger/bold, a bit more distance from header
- rename rec to harvest, port on pcb more obvious
- harvest dAC ch-b - drain power source OK?
- improve marking on Voltages, maybe with an arrow
- reverse diode of mosfet is too weak - already destroyed the reverse polarity protection
- some popular Flag-Markers on backside for pinheader
- Pin1 dot should be a shallow/sharp triangle, pointing in the right direction (less confusing in dense layouts)
- transistor-footprint is not conform to datasheet, it is slighly bigger and just misses the pads?!?
- u13 thermal to wide, reduce a bit to avoid shorts (u15 has same possible weakness)
- rework als Pin-Descriptions (already mentioned)
- round and divided (big) paste pads
- add general power-led when shepherd is on? maybe on 6V line
- switch to thinner stencil, bigger pads (paste is good for it)
- header-row on target has paste, it should not
- Font/Writing in copper is unreadable on target (slighly below spec)
- add layer for manual / pick'and'place descriptions (m15, m?)
- qr code is not readable, blurred, reduce size of "pixel"
- warning for harvest V_sense ⇾ Voltage floats if not connected and will most likely show V-Max in this state
- ADC nRST should not get A5V, only 3.3, also there is no need for a resistor-switch
- Connector for external switch was copied from old schematic, but this one had inversed pin-numbering on connector, different from datasheet
- Testpoint on RVS-Pin of
- protect GND better around Pinheaders
- U25A, Inputs are switched
- diode between both 5V-lines should be two diodes that feed the watchdog
- 3V3 should also be switched - maybe even the 5V0 in, so the PU that hinder bootup are meaningless
- vias came back only weak tainted (make it less severe if that happens), mainly for target pcb
- more distance to gnd-plane (soldering is hard, even with thermals
- TEST Watchdog, make compatible with BB
- TEST GPIO to and from target
- same orientation for transistors
- switch p8-27 and 29 (batOK / GPIO4) for cleaner readout
- switch p8-43/44 with p8-39/40 for proper boot
- TEST boot with all pins except 3v3 & 5V
- but make sure that shepherd-EN (p8-13) stays low during boot
- switching main power to both targets shows, that the routes seem to have different current-readings for the same load! odd
- 1k for LEDs
- check surroundings of mosfets, size has changed
- mosfet of watchdog-wake could be tied to 3V3 with additional 1k resistor or diode (so that button stays usable)
    - 100k PD for wd-pin (or keep 10k)
    - 3V3 goes low on powerdown, so watchdog can enable (pull low wake) BB again,
    - polling has no effect during normal operation
    - TEST if 1k is enough to pull line low to enable ⇾ it is
- add open source hardware logo?


## Schematic Changes - Open

- prepare calibration
- ordered not enough 15uH Coils, need 30 more
- check remainder of BOM for emu-only assembly
- shepV1 had a user-space led, which is still there, same pin, but pru-controlled, was it the same in v1?
- explain schematics,

## Part Changes

Note: after Mouser-Order - NOW already ordered

- DAC       100nF ⇾ 1uF
- Boost     10uF ⇾ 10uF (inv)
- Inv       +47uF
- Rec       2x 10k 0603 ⇾ 0402
- All       34x 1uF/16V/0603 ⇾ 1uF/25V/0402
- final Shield, cover & frame
- all       4x 15uH/4mm ⇾ 15uH/3mm
- parts of nRF-Target

## Schematic Changes Postponed

- internal calibration? with 2 switches and 1 calibration-linear-power-supply
- OP-Amp, bias Subtractor: LMP7701MF, not needed now
- sync to pps ⇾ external pcb
- usb-socket is impossible to hand-solder right now
- (maybe) add PU to watchdog outputs
- separate PCBs for PPS-Source, Recorder, Emulator

### Open Issues

- only 5 diodes of type PMEG in order?
- change 100 uF to 47u? one less component
- Testpad should be square for GND, half-circle for Signal or similar
- r3 (dac, emu)
- proper naming for TP if there is space

- TPs should have bigger hole, so probes stick
- oscillating opAmp should be outside of cage
- allow install of a big cap on A5V or 5V, 5v5 1F is cheap
- add longer pinheader for p8/p9 23-46
